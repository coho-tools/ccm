Coho-Model(CCM): Coho Circuit Modeling Tool
  CCM is a toolset for simplifying the circuit model works for both simulation and formal verification. 
  It provide a object-oriented circuit interface for users, which enables reuse and easily extension. 
  Users only need to specify the circuit layout, the tool will automatically provide ODE interface for simulation, 
  or linear differential inclusion interface for formal verification, and do the optimization automatically.
