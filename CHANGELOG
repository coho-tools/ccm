2014-11-22: version 1.0
  Create the Coho Circuit Model tool from OpenCoho.
  1. Re-organize the architecture
    a. Make it independent with reachability analysis codes
    b. Make clean interface for device Models, circuit libraries. Which could be easily changed and modified. 
  2. New features
    a. Implement the vectorization feature for improving performance
    b. Support non-MOS circuits, e.g. RC, doesn't support L
    c. Support current source and voltage sources via testbench, add vsin for voltage source 
    d. Generalized the code for support general device models and circuit libraries. 
    e. Add new circuits to the coho library
    f. Provide smaller mat files for public.
    g. More test codes
  3. Clean up codes
    a. remove many unused codes, device models and circuits 
    b. easier interface for configurate the software
    c. code format
