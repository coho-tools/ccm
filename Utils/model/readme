I. How to get model data by spice
  spice_simu_ptm: the main matlab program to generate the table
  clean.sh: remove hspice redundant files
  180nm_bulk.pm: PTM 180 process parameters

  NOTE: It only shows an demo to get hspice data. 
  It's only for UBC environment, may not work in other place

  # Setup environment for HSPICE
  # NOTE: It doesn't work now, can't get license 
  csh
  source /isd/CMC/bin/hspice.csh
  bash
  hspice

II. How to compute other models based on nmos and pmos models
  1. Compute simulation model for macro circuits based on simulation models of transistors
	  comp_smos: for transistors whose source is connected to substrate.
	  comp_inv: for inverter
  2. Compute quadratic model from simulation models.
	  comp_quadModel: compute the quadratic model from the simulation model
		lft_lsm: used by above function
