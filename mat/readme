This package include default mat files used by Coho-Model. 
It includes two fabrications 
  1. PTM: predictive technology process, see ptm.asu.edu for details 
  2. TSMC: due to license problem, we can't open the data 
The location of the mat file is calculated as 
  ./<fab>/<process>/<type>/<name>.mat  
The mat file contains 
  data: model data for each grid 
  err:  error term for each grid, could be [] or scalar
  GRID: grid information
    v0: initial value for grid 0
    nv: number of grids
    dv: unit length of grids
  SIZE: circuit size
    len,wid: length and width
  META: meta-info
    type: 'simu' or 'quad' 
    *lib: 'coho'
    *name: unique name of the device
    *fab:  fab, e.g. TSMC, INTEL, PTM 
    *process: e.g. 180nm, 10nm. 
    *gnd/vdd: voltage for gnd/vdd
    *nodes: nodes names
    *desc: description of the circuit

To add a new set of mat files, you should 
1. Provide mat files that contains all data list above, except the one with * to make Coho-Model works.
2. If the mat files do not follow the same method, please update the function for finding mat files by
   ccm_cfg('set','matFileFunc');
3. There are utilites functions under $CCM/Utils/model/*, which could be helpful for generatint mat files
